## 📋 Overview

This presentation introduces the concept of **Migration Engineering as Code** using [OpenRewrite](https://openrewrite.org/), an automated code refactoring framework for Java and other languages.

Learn how to:

* Automate code migrations using pre-built and custom recipes
* Apply refactoring at scale across large codebases
* Create and run your own migration logic programmatically
